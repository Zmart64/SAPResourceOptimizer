# Resource Prediction

Predict peak memory requirements for distributed build jobs using a
combination of feature engineering and machine-learning models.

This project implements an automated ML pipeline that optimizes memory allocation
for CI/CD build systems, minimizing both out-of-memory failures and resource waste
through advanced hyperparameter optimization and business-focused metrics.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management:

```console
# Install Poetry (macOS/Linux)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Or via pip  
pip install poetry
```

### Setup

```console
# Install dependencies (including development tools)
poetry install --with dev

# Activate the Poetry shell
poetry shell

# Or run commands with poetry run prefix
poetry run python --version
```

### Using Models

The project provides a `DeployableModel` wrapper for consistent model loading and prediction:

```python
from resource_prediction.models import DeployableModel

# Load any model type
model = DeployableModel.load("artifacts/trained_models/lightgbm_classification.pkl")

# Make predictions (preprocessing happens automatically)
predictions = model.predict(raw_dataframe)

# Get model information  
model_info = model.get_model_info()
print(f"Model: {model_info['model_type']} ({model_info['task_type']})")
```

### Documentation

Full project documentation is available in the `docs/` directory. To build and view the documentation locally:

```console
# Build the documentation
make html

# Build and serve the documentation (auto-opens in browser)
make serve

# For development: clean, build, and serve
make dev
```
```

**Benefits of DeployableModel Architecture:**
- üîÑ **Unified Interface** - All models implement `BasePredictor` for consistency
- üß† **Integrated Preprocessing** - `ModelPreprocessor` handles feature engineering automatically
- üèóÔ∏è **Production Ready** - Complete serialization with metadata and preprocessing pipeline
- üì¶ **Extensible Design** - Easy to add new models following the same pattern
- ÔøΩ **Type Safety** - Clear separation between model logic and deployment wrapper

### Documentation

Full project documentation is available in the `docs/` directory. To build and view the documentation locally:

```console
# Build the documentation
make html

# Build and serve the documentation (auto-opens in browser)
make serve

# For development: clean, build, and serve
make dev
```

The documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and should automatically open in your browser.

**Alternative manual commands:**
```console
# If you prefer manual commands
poetry run sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html
poetry run python serve_docs.py
```

## Imagined "how to use" workflow

### 1. First run

```console
# Activate Poetry environment
poetry shell

# Run full pipeline for classification
python main.py --model-type classification --run-search
```

### 2. Subsequent run (skipping preprocessing)

```console
# Now regression, but re-use preprocessed data from first run
python main.py --model-type regression --skip-preprocessing --run-search
```

## Features

- **Multiple ML Approaches**: Regression and classification models for memory prediction
- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optuna-based optimization with parallel execution
- **Business-Focused Metrics**: Cost-aware objective function balancing failures vs waste
- **Rich Feature Engineering**: Temporal, categorical, and rolling window features
- **Unified Model Architecture**: Standardized BasePredictor interface for all models
- **Interactive Web Applications**: Streamlit-based dashboards for model exploration
- **Production-Ready**: Poetry dependency management, comprehensive testing, and documentation

## Supported Models

**Regression Models** (predict exact memory values):
- Quantile Ensemble (GradientBoosting + XGBoost)
- XGBoost Regression
- LightGBM Regression

**Classification Models** (predict memory bins):
- XGBoost Classifier
- LightGBM Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression

## Architecture

The pipeline implements a business-focused optimization objective:

**Business Score = 5 √ó Under-allocation% + Over-allocation%**

This reflects that memory under-allocation (causing build failures) is 5x more 
costly than over-allocation (wasting resources).

### Model Architecture

The project uses a clean model architecture:

- **BasePredictor Interface**: All models implement consistent `fit()` and `predict()` methods
- **DeployableModel Wrapper**: Production-ready wrapper with integrated preprocessing
- **ModelPreprocessor**: Handles feature engineering automatically

## How to Extend

### Adding New Models

To add a new model type:

1. **Implement BasePredictor interface** in `resource_prediction/models/`
2. **Add to model registry** in `resource_prediction/models/__init__.py`  
3. **Configure model family** in `resource_prediction/config.py`
4. **Define search space** in `config.py`
5. **Add trainer integration** in `resource_prediction/training/trainer.py`

See the documentation for detailed examples.

### Customizing Business Logic

- Modify the business scoring function in `Trainer` class
- Adjust the 5:1 penalty ratio for under vs over-allocation  
- Add new metrics (SLA compliance, cost thresholds, etc.)

### Interactive Web Application

The project includes a unified Streamlit web application for model exploration:

```console
# Launch the main application (only one needed)
streamlit run app/app.py
```

The application features:
- **Model Selection**: Radio button interface to choose between 4 different models:
  - Classification
  - Quantile Ensemble (3 variants: Balanced, Tiny Under-allocation, Small Waste)
- **Interactive Prediction**: Real-time memory prediction with simulation data
- **Visualization**: Live charts showing prediction behavior over time
- **Simulation Mode**: Automatic batch processing with configurable delay
- **Model-Specific Interfaces**: Each model type has its own optimized interface

The app dynamically loads the appropriate model and configuration based on user selection, with helper modules in the subdirectories (`app/qe/`, `app/classification/`) providing model-specific functionality.
