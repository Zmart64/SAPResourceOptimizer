# Resource Prediction

Predict peak memory requirements for distributed build jobs using a
combination of feature engineering and machine-learning models.

This project implements an automated ML pipeline that optimizes memory allocation
for CI/CD build systems, minimizing both out-of-memory failures and resource waste
through advanced hyperparameter optimization and business-focused metrics.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management:

```console
# Install Poetry (macOS/Linux)
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

# Or via pip  
pip install poetry
```

### Setup

```console
# Install dependencies (including development tools)
poetry install --with dev

# Activate the Poetry shell
poetry shell

# Or run commands with poetry run prefix
poetry run python --version
```

### Documentation

Full project documentation is available in the `docs/` directory. To build and view the documentation locally:

```console
# Build the documentation
make html

# Build and serve the documentation (auto-opens in browser)
make serve

# For development: clean, build, and serve
make dev
```

The documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000` and should automatically open in your browser.

**Alternative manual commands:**
```console
# If you prefer manual commands
poetry run sphinx-build -b html docs docs/_build/html
poetry run python serve_docs.py
```

## Imagined "how to use" workflow

### 1. First run

```console
# Activate Poetry environment
poetry shell

# Run full pipeline for classification
python main.py --model-type classification --run-search
```

### 2. Subsequent run (skipping preprocessing)

```console
# Now regression, but re-use preprocessed data from first run
python main.py --model-type regression --skip-preprocessing --run-search
```

## Features

- **Multiple ML Approaches**: Regression and classification models for memory prediction
- **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optuna-based optimization with parallel execution
- **Business-Focused Metrics**: Cost-aware objective function balancing failures vs waste
- **Rich Feature Engineering**: Temporal, categorical, and rolling window features
- **Production-Ready**: Poetry dependency management, comprehensive testing, and documentation

## Supported Models

**Regression Models** (predict exact memory values):
- Quantile Ensemble (GradientBoosting + XGBoost)
- XGBoost Regression
- Random Forest Regression

**Classification Models** (predict memory bins):
- XGBoost Classifier
- LightGBM Classifier  
- CatBoost Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Logistic Regression

## Architecture

The pipeline implements a business-focused optimization objective:

**Business Score = 5 Ã— Under-allocation% + Over-allocation%**

This reflects that memory under-allocation (causing build failures) is 5x more 
costly than over-allocation (wasting resources).

## How to Extend

### Adding New Models

1. Create model implementation in `resource_prediction/models/`
2. Add hyperparameter search space to `Config.get_search_space()`
3. Register in `Config.MODEL_FAMILIES` dictionary
4. Update command-line options if needed

### Customizing Business Logic

- Modify the business scoring function in `Trainer` class
- Adjust the 5:1 penalty ratio for under vs over-allocation  
- Add new metrics (SLA compliance, cost thresholds, etc.)
